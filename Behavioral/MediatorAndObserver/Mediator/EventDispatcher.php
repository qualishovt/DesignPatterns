 * The Event Dispatcher class acts as a Mediator and contains the subscription
 * and notification logic. While a classic Mediator often depends on concrete
 * component classes, this one is only tied to their abstract interfaces.
 *
 * We are able to achieve this level of indirection thanks to the way the
 * connections between components are established. The components themselves may
 * subscribe to specific events that they are interested in via the Mediator's
 * subscription interface.
 *
 * Note, we can't use the PHP's built-in Subject/Observer interfaces here
 * because we'll be stretching them too far from what they were designed for.
