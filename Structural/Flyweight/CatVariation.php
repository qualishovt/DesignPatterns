     * This method displays the cat information. The method accepts the
     * extrinsic  state as arguments. The rest of the state is stored inside
     * Flyweight's fields.
     *
     * You might be wondering why we had put the primary cat's logic into the
     * CatVariation class instead of keeping it in the Cat class. I agree, it
     * does sound confusing.
     *
     * Keep in mind that in the real world, the Flyweight pattern can either be
     * implemented from the start or forced onto an existing application
     * whenever the developers realize they've hit upon a RAM problem.
     *
     * In the latter case, you end up with such classes as we have here. We kind
     * of "refactored" an ideal app where all the data was initially inside the
     * Cat class. If we had implemented the Flyweight from the start, our class
     * names might be different and less confusing. For example, Cat and
     * CatContext.
     *
     * However, the actual reason why the primary behavior should live in the
     * Flyweight class is that you might not have the Context class declared at
     * all. The context data might be stored in an array or some other more
     * efficient data structure. You won't have another place to put your
     * methods in, except the Flyweight class.
